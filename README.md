# Eklipse Data Analysis Skill Test

This repository contains a data analysis project conducted for **Eklipse**, a cutting-edge platform specializing in automated game clip generation. The primary objective of this skill test was to demonstrate the ability to extract and analyze key business metrics from raw data, providing actionable insights into the platform's performance.

## Project Overview

The core work involved a multi-faceted approach to understanding Eklipse's operational landscape:

* **Strategic Metric Definition:** Key performance indicators (KPIs) were thoughtfully defined across vital business domains:
    * **User Engagement & Activity:** Understanding how users interact with the platform.
    * **Content & Product Performance:** Assessing the effectiveness and appeal of generated clips.
    * **Monetization & Business Growth:** Analyzing the health and growth of premium subscriptions.

* **SQL-Driven Data Extraction:** Robust SQL queries were developed to precisely extract these defined metrics directly from the raw dataset. Each query was designed to be efficient and adhered to specific technical requirements, including the use of joins across multiple tables.

* **Interactive Data Visualization:** Python, utilizing the Plotly library, was employed to create dynamic and interactive line charts. These visualizations illustrate trends and patterns of the extracted metrics over time, making complex data easily digestible and insightful.

## What This Analysis Reveals

The insights derived from this project offer a clear picture of Eklipse's performance, including:

* **User Behavior Trends:** A deeper understanding of how users are engaging with the platform, from initial gamesession submissions to clip generation and interaction.
* **Content Effectiveness:** Evaluation of how valuable and shareable the AI-generated clips are to the user base.
* **Monetization Health:** Insights into the growth trajectory of premium users and the factors influencing subscription retention.
